      <h1 class="project-title">About me</h1>
      <h2>I'm Rob and I'm hugely passionate about user centered design!</h2>
      <p>My career has spanned different industries from <strong>Ministry of Justice</strong>,<strong> Met Police</strong>,<strong> Agency</strong>, <strong>Local Government</strong> and also <strong>freelance</strong>.
	  </p>
	  <p>I've worked across design and development, as a front-end developer, digital designer, graphic designer and most currently, as a UX/UI designer.</p>
	  <p>Over the last few years my main focus has been on creating online solutions for Local Authority with users and accessibility at the center of my work.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Graphic designer</li>
            <li>Visual design</li>
            <li>Front-end development</li>
            <li>Interaction design</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>What my focus is at the moment</h2>
      <p>When it comes to creating designs I always looked at the visual (form) instead of how it worked best for users (function). I have spent the last few years changing my paradigm when it comes to creating designs for real people.</p>
	  <p>I am a huge advocate for the Government Digital Services and as an Interaction Designer at the Ministry of Justice, I love how we create clean and transparent services for everyone - our method of working is to go out and speak to people; to find out what the real problems are when trying to do something online and to make iterative improvements to services for the public.</p>
	  <p>I'm currently undertaking a Leadership Programme as i've spent nearly 6 years as a senior designer working to develop others and help create friendly communties of design that people love to work in.</p>
