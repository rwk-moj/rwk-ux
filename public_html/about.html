      <h1 class="project-title">About me</h1>
      <h2>I'm Rob and I passionate about all things design.</h2>
      <p>I started out designing things for the Police nearly 10 years ago and over the last few years I've spent time in the following practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Graphic Designer</li>
            <li>Digital Designer</li>
            <li>Web Designer / Developer</li>
            <li>UX/UI Designer and Developer</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>What my focus is at the moment</h2>
      <p>When it comes to creating designs I always looked at the visual (form) instead of how it worked best for users (function). I have spent the last few years changing my paradigm when it comes to creating designs for real people.</p>
	  <p>I am a huge advocate for the Government Digital Services and I love how they create clean and transparent services for everyone - their method of working is to go out and speak to people; to find out what the real problems are when trying to do something online and to make continuous improvements to services for the public.</p>
	  <p>I have embodied this ethos at my current place of work and continue to drive forward the same princples of good design with a strong focus on accessibilty.</p>
