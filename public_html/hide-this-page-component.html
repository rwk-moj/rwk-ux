            <h1 class="project-title">Hide this page component - submission to GDS Design System</h1>
            <h2>The project</h2>
            <summary><p>Whilst working on my delivery team in the Legal Aid Agency I identified a high-risk gap in the UK Government's website that put users at risk of harm In particular, victims of Domestic Abuse.</p></summary>
            <summary><p>Assessing the risk to users, I led a collaborative Government response to create a new component that allows users to quickly hide their current page and open a new, ambiguous webpage, such as BBC Weather. This would lower the risk of drawing attention to browsing habits from a perpetrator.</p></summary>
            <h2>My role</h2>
            <p>I led the reponse to this work from the Ministry of Justice, writing the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/213" title="Hide this page component issue">Design System backlog issue</a>, but also coordinated the joined up submission and <a href="https://deploy-preview-1381--govuk-design-system-preview.netlify.app/components/hide-this-page/" title="Deploy preview of Hide this page component">writing the implementation guidance</a>, working closely with the Head of the GOV.UK Design System to respond to queries.</p>
            <p>I was responsible for creating designs from concept through to final delivery and establish the narrative for the delivery team undestand the importance of the user needs.</p>
            <p>I was also responsible for coordinating the joint effort of writing the implementation guidance that was submitted to the Design System Working Group, and acted as the single point of contact for all queries from the Head of Interaction Design at GDS.
            <h2>Working as part of an agile team and establishing a working group</h2>
            <p>Within the MoJ, I led the multi-disciplinary delivery team throughout the project, working with a:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Content Designer</li>
                <li>User Researcher</li>
                <li>Product Manager</li>
                <li>Front-end Developer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This work required a cross-government response to the challenge. Using cross Government Slack channels and networking, I identified several Departments that were keen to implement a similar component on their services.</p>
            <p>I quickly establised a working group to begin the process of creating a unified approach to this project. Members of the group were from different professions and from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Department for Work and Pensions</strong> - User Researcher</li>
                <li><strong>Cabinet Office</strong> - Product Manager</li>
                <li><strong>Scottish Government</strong> - Senior Interaction Designer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I ensured the working group met every few weeks over a period of 6 months to ensure that we were working towards the same goals and were able to discuss how to progress our collaborative work.</p>
            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <p>The biggest risk to a victim of Domestic Abuse is homicide and serious physical assaults - this is at its greatest risk when a victim is planning to flee or escape from the perpetrator. Often, one of the first things a victim will do is to speak to someone to make a disclosure about abuse.</p>
            <p>The second thing they will do is research and find help online, often using Government services.</p>
            <p>By not having a way for users to be able to safely hide their browser, we were putting our users across Government that use our services at risk.</p>
            <p>I created the following user story for the delivery team for our us to ensure that we were starting off our work with the basic user needs.</p>
            <blockquote><span>User story</span>As someone who is at risk, I need to quickly and safely be able to change or close my browser window and clear my browser history to prevent someone else from seeing my screen and search history.</blockquote>
            <h2>My approach</h2>   
            <h3>Delivery team work</h3>
            <p>Within the delivery team, we identified through speaking to a subject matter expert - someone who worked with Domestic Abuse survivors - that it was more important to have something than nothing on our service and set out to create an MVP to keep users safe.</p>
            <p>I set out <strong>creating rapid sketches</strong> to look at user flows through our Legal Aid service and what type of component we would need to create.</p>
            <figure class="compare">
               <img src="images/htp_image1.jpg" class="example" alt="Sketches of a component">
              <figcaption>Sketch looked at existing components that could be extended.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure class="compare">
               <img src="images/htp_image2.jpg" class="example " alt="Sketches of a component">              
              <figcaption>These rapid sketches helped quickly ideate on desktop and mobile an MVP to implement on the LAA live service.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>These initial sketches were discussed with the delivery team and the preferred solution was mocked up in a higher fidelity design using the GDS prototyping kit.</p>
            <p>Due to the time critical aspect of this work and the fact we were going to be extending the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> component, I chose to build in the kit to save time.</p>
            <p>Utilising the Design System, I created two MVP design concepts and presented these back to the Delivery Team. Talking the team through the design options, I proposed we used the red button as it signified a destructive action more clearly than a green button that within the GOV.UK colour palette is used for completing a task.</p>
            <h4>Desktop screen designs using GOV.UK page 2/3 width layout</h4>
            <figure class="compare">
               <img src="images/htp_green_iteration.png" class="example" alt="Prototype kit iteration - green">
              <figcaption>Design used the green button component.</figcaption>
            </figure>

              <figcaption>Design used the red button component.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I led on running a design sprint and SME feedback session that allowed us to capture feedback on the component itself, but also identify the risks to users. This was all captured on a miro board which enabled us to have a holistic overview of our approach to the component.</p>
            <p>I also used this board to capture feedback from testing of the prototype with the SME, the team and other designers, developers and accessibility specialists across the MoJ. In addition to this, I presented our work to the weekly Design System meeting for feedback.</p>

              <figcaption>Miro was also used to capture and note feedback from other professions and the SME from on the MVP </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Collaborating with other Government departments</h3>
            <p>Underpinning all of this MVP work within the MoJ, I coordinated meetings with DWP, Cabinet Office and eventually the Scottish Government. At these sessions, I facilitated the conversations around aligning our design and functionality and ensured that the developers were communicating and code sharing.</p>
            <p>At each stage of new iteration I ensured the working group would get together to discuss any changes on the designs to share research and align our designs and functionality.</p>
            <h4>Iterating on the design and language</h4>
            <p>At a key meeting, the group discussed changing the language from 'Quick Exit' to 'Hide this page'. This decision was taken because it had been tested by DWP, and tested well with charities.</p>
            <p>In addition, the use of 'Hide this page' presented more of a sense of immediacy, as well as being more descriptive of what the button actually does when the user interacts with the button, so we moved away from 'Quick Exit'.</p>

              <figcaption>The designs iterated over several months, with language - position and functionality all changing based on user need.</figcaption>

            <h2>Outcomes</h2>
            <h3>Outcomes for the organisation</h3>
            <p>I wanted to quickly sketch out a rough wireframe of the structure of how the new site's basic components would work. These were based off of the GOV.UK structure that kept things simple and didn't add unecessary information.</p>
            <p>Following user testing and research, I was able to move from an XD prototype to HTML quickly which allowed us to begin the Alpha phase earlier than planned.</p>
            <p>I was presented with an opportunity to run our designs past several Departments in Central Government who provided constructive critiques that influenced some of the design decisions in XD.</p>

              <figcaption>I created a number of design concepts in XD before arriving at a final design that was interactive.</figcaption>

              <img src="images/prototype_html.jpg" class="example" alt="HTML prototype">
              <figcaption>The HTML prototype was built quickly once the XD design had been signed off by the product owner.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Outcomes for the user</h3>
            <p>In November 2017, I proceeded to the beta phase where we were in a position to live test with members of the public.
            </p>
            <p>As part of this process I developed a content reporting form to capture user feedback. This was positioned at the bottom of every page to enable me to see what page a user was reporting on. The data was sent to a Trello board and mailbox. The feedback was then assessed and actioned according to the priority status.</p>
            <p>I also built a general feedback form that captured whether users wished to be involved in focus groups and user testing sessions which I organised and facilitated at the Council offices. This allowed us to further refine the website design and look at areas that were successful or proved difficult to the user.</p>
            <h2>Moving to live and making changes from beta feedback</h2>
            <p>In February 2018, after iterating on the beta design using detailed user feedback it was moved to live.  
            </p>
            <p>Since the website has been launched we have continuously worked with members of the public and other local authorities to improve the user experience. I have made several improvements all focussed on the needs of our users, such as: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Built new templates to make it easier for users to read content</li>
              <li>Included Google Translate to make it easier for our residents to access different languages</li>
              <li>Made several changes to our HTML markup and branding to improve online accessibility</li>
              <li>Running a project to look at PDF to HTML content for accessibility</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Continuous improvement</h2>
            <p>Our committment to improving the experience of using Maidstone Borough Council's website is continuous as new ways of accessing our site changes and the needs of users change. We are currently in a discovery/beta phase to <a href="/improving-our-homepage" title="Read about how we are improving the MBC homepage">look in more detail at our homepage</a> to see how we can make it even easier for our users.
