            <h1 class="project-title">Implementing a new webcasting system at MBC</h1>
            <h1>DELETE</h1>
            <p>To deliver an improved accessible webcasting system for Service and members of the public.</p>
            <h2>My role in an agile delivery team</h2>
            <p>I was the designer and technical lead from discovery through to live, working in an agile team, comprised of network engineers, a delivery manager and a product owner.</p>

              <figcaption>The new webcasting system has reduced setup time, saved on annual costs and improved the quality and accessibility for users.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2>User research</h2>
            <p>There were two groups of users identified in the initial research stages of the discovery phase.<p/>
              <ul>
                <li>Back office users who would need to maintain and manage the live streams, set the room up and adjust cameras</li>
                <li>Nembers of the public who would watch the livestreams</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Speaking to back office staff I identifed a real need to simplify the existing setup process to reduce the time it took to setup the system before the meetings but also improving the quality of the cameras.</p>
            <p>From members of the public, it was important to be able to have transparency during the live stream when it came to voting and keeping disruptions in streaming to a minimum.</p>
            <h2>Looking what other Council's have done</h2>
            <p>Utilising Slack, I contacted several Council's to find out what solutions they had in place and their experiences of using them.</p>
            <p>From a range of responses, Youtube had presented itself as a popular, open source solution to hosting and live streaming content, as well as saving other Council's large annual costs. Presenting the information to the Product Owner with proposed effeciency savings as well as an improved media player and improved user interface allowed us to gain approval to move forward.</p>
