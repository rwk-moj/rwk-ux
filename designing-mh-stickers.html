          <h1 class="project-title">Mental health - Civil servant super hero stickers...
          </h1>
            <h2>The project</h2>
            <summary><p>I have always been very open about my mental health. From a young age I struggled with confidence, bullying and sadly, self harm. I strongly believe though that this greatly contributed to the empathetic and emotionally supportive person I am today.</p></summary>
            <summary><p>I figured I would put my creativity to good use to create a sticker that represented how I feel about my work and something that I am close to - what better theme than mental health.</p></summary>
            <h2>Getting inspiration from Twitter</h2>
            <p>Whilst perusing twitter I noticed a conversation between some civil servants about mental health and that how do people help others that might be struggling.</p> 
            <p>One senior civil servant commented that they seek out people that they can help, as by doing so it helps them feel better.</p>
            <p>Initially I offered to help someone (oh the irony!) who wanted to design some stickers around that mantra of helping others.</p>
            <p>I had a few conversations about what they wanted the design to feel like and we discussed font and imagery and messaging. The standard 'client' and designer back and forth that happens in a design brief.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately due to busy schedules the sticker design process fell flat and lost momentum.</p>
            <h2>Until I started at the MoJ...</h2>   
            <p>I've always been obsessed with a good sticker and in December 2019, shortly after joining the MOJ I felt inspired to have another crack at what i'd started.</p>
            <p>I've spent the best part of my 17 year career working in the public sector. Often, working in the public sector is seen as less exciting work, less benefits - an inferior environment to private sector.</p>
            <p>However. We help others get things done that they need to, often in difficult times. I'm not saying we are super heroes, but...well...yeah I kind of am.</p>
            <p>I used this idea of superheros to create some new designs based on the marvel characters (deciding to leave out my favourite - the hulk - we don't always smash stuff in the public sector) and pairing it with the phrase borrowed from the SCS on Twitter...</p>
            <blockquote><h3>Find someone you can help</h3></blockquote>

              <figcaption>The superheros represent the incredible kindness and empathy of Civil Servants and how we can all help people during hard times.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I created a bulk of these designs for all the marvel (and my wife's favourite, Batman which is obviously DC!) characters and had them printed by a company called Diginate who created some wonderful quality stickers.</p>
            <p>I wanted to give these to people - not just any people - those who genuinely have a desire to want to help people, that might go some way to helping themselves.</p>
            <p>I sent quite a few around the MoJ Mental Health community group - have sent some to the civil servant who <em>established</em> the saying. But most recently I gave one to a best friend who has always been a bit of a rock to me in the past.</p>
            <p>This was what his wife posted and if the above wasn't enough to make it a worthwhile project, this was.</p>

               <img style="width:320px" src="images/insta.jpg" class="example" alt="Instagram post">

            <blockquote><span>Instagram quote</span>In a time where we are all feeling uncertain and all of our mental health is being pushed to breaking point. My husband brought home this sticker and it just makes sense.</blockquote>
            <p>It doesn't matter where people put these, the fact that people can take such a simple message and use it to potentially turn someone's day into a positive is truly a marvel<strong>*</strong> of human nature and compassion.</p>
            <p><strong>*</strong> (the pun wasn't intended but at 3am writing this maybe it was)</p>
            <h2>Oh, but there's a sequel!</h2>
            <p>Amanda Smith, our Head of User Centred Policy at the MoJ, who is an absolute hero in our community, said to me that they would love to see a Black Panther sticker. Due to time (having had a baby) and funds (moving into our first home) I haven't been able to create these.</p>
            <p>But I will shortly be creating a commemorative sticker in honour of Chadwick Boseman who helped so many people in so many ways and was truly a superhero, the Black Panther.</p>
