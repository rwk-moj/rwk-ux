          <h1 class="project-title">Redesigning the user experience of our call handling system
          </h1>
            <strong>Note - this project has been simplified as parts of it are not for public view. Screenshots have been blurred to hide sensitive information.</strong>
            <h2>The project</h2>
            <summary><p>The Legal Aid Agency use a Call Handling System that allows members of the public to request a call back from operators to hep support them through their legal aid journey.</p></summary>
            <summary><p>If a user is eligible for Legal Aid, the operator will then assign their case over to a specialist provider.</p></summary>
            <h2>My Role in the agile team</h2>
            <p>I worked as the senior designer on this project, working with a multi disciplinary agile delivery team.</p>
            <p>For this specific piece of work, I worked closely with the following team members:</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Content Designer</li>
                <li>Business analyst</li>
                <li>Backend developer</li>
                <li>Product manager</li>
                <li>Delivery manager</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I created user flows in both low and high fidelity that I used to convey the user experience and design proposals to the team and stakeholders.</p>
            <figure>
               <img src="images/flows_chs.jpg" class="example" alt="Sketches of flows and component">
              <figcaption>This sketch was used to understand where I needed to get new alert / notification components showing in the system.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I coordinated design sprints with team members to look at the various aspects of the design challenges and to iterate on concepts.</p> 
            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <p>Call operators identified an issue with the CHS that would cause certain cases to be incorrectly routed to specialist providers.</p>
            <p>The product manager created several tickets in the teams backlog to create a new process, and look at design proposals for a new way of allowing operators to correctly and clearly route users through the system.</p>
            <p>This challenge was urgent as it was creating a lot of problems further down the legal aid journey.</p>
            <h2>My approach</h2>   
            <h3>Understanding the system</h3>
            <p>I began this work by researching through historical use of the CHS service and familiarising myself with our staging platform so that could understand how operators currently processed users as they came through the service.</p>
            <p>With an understanding of the problem, I sketched out some initial user flows, new screens and alert messages that would help operators with this problem.</p>
            <p>I discussed these concepts with the business analyst who worked closely with the stakeholders and operators and we agreed to move the concepts into higher fidelity designs.</p>
             <blockquote><span>User story</span>As a call centre operator, I want to let clients who have a Public Law problem to skip the financial means assessment so that they are all passed through to a specialist provider (as they should be under the law)</blockquote>
            <p>It's important to note that at this time of working, we were without a user researcher on the team. If we had one, these designs would have been discussed with them with a view to test any proposals with our operators and stakeholders in a more formal and efficient way.</p>
            <p>As there was no code based prototype for CHS for me to work in to quickly prototype, I used a combination of dev tools in Chrome and Sketch to modify screenshots of the following design assets:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>New screens to be added to existing flows</li>
              <li>New alert components that highlighted essential information to operators</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Design iteration 1</h3>
            <figure>
               <img src="images/chs_iteration_1.jpg" class="example" alt="Sketches of flows and component">
              <figcaption>This end-to-end flow was the first iteration</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Design iteration 2</h3>
            <figure>
               <img src="images/chs_iteration_2.png" class="example" alt="Sketches of flows and component">
              <figcaption>Second iteration of flows based on feedback from stakeholders and team</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Design iteration 3</h3>
            <figure>
               <img src="images/chs_final_iteration.png" class="example" alt="Sketches of flows and component">
              <figcaption>Final iteration of flows based on feedback from stakeholders and team</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Working with the content designer, I created several design iterations which myself and our BA presented back to our stakeholders over several conference calls to take them through design decisions and listen to their feedback.</p>
            <p>After several rounds iterations and sign off from our stakeholders the design work was handed over to our developers to implement the new flows and components on the staging platform.</p>
            <figure>
               <img src="images/alert_comp.jpg" class="example" alt="Sketches of flows and component">
              <figcaption>Blurred design of the component on the system</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>These developmental changes were tested by the team and also certain stakeholders to ensure that before moving into production they were meeting the user needs and also consistent with the designs.</p>
            <p>I'm addition to this, I presented our work to the wider Justice Services community to share working and promote the fantastic work that the team had carried out on behalf of our stakeholders.</p>
            <h2>Outcomes</h2>
            <h3>Outcomes for the user</h3>
            <p>The key outcome for the user was two fold.</p>
            <p>Firstly these changes were gratefully met by the contract manager who presented our work to the service owner.</p>
            <p>Operators were able to clearly identify when users were going through a specific part of the journey by allowing them to easily choose the correct option on the interface.</p>
            <p>They were also clearly alerted to supporting information through the use of a new alert component that informed their decision making whilst on the phone to users.</p>
            <h3>Outcomes for the business</h3>
            <p>This work provided a rapid , critical change to the service that helped reduce any long term problems for the public, operators and specialist providers using the service.</p>
            <p>We received great feedback from the contract manager on our work with them informing us that the design presentations made it very clear for them to understand the processes.</p>
